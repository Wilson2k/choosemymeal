## Choose My Meal

Don't know where to eat? Tired of asking your partner where to go and taking ages to decide? This is a web app to solve just that. Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and leveraging the [Yelp Fusion API](https://docs.developer.yelp.com/docs), this app chooses a random place to eat for you. The live deployment is located at [https://foodapp-wilson2k.vercel.app](https://foodapp-wilson2k.vercel.app) for you to use.

Alternatively, to run the app locally, get a Yelp Fusion API key, and place it in the nex.config.js file. Then to run the app locally:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Finally, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to use the app.
